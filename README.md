# pycon-numtheo
for pycon 2015
These are number theory introduction functions put forth to support my pycoon 2015 proposel.These are highly optimized(from
my perspective)and use mix of easy and complex mathematical concepts and practises to optimize them.
Note: Due to optimization reasons some of these functions will work in python 2.7 while other in 3.4.I will soon remedy this.
Sorry for the inconvenience.
